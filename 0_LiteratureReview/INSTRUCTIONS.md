# Literature Review

## Overview
This project explores traffic sign identification using TinyML. To understand existing approaches, we reviewed relevant literature and identified key factors like common models, data formats, dataset sizes, and pretrained models.

ðŸ”¹ Findings:
âœ” CNN-based models like MobileNet are widely used
âœ” Images must be properly labeled for training
âœ” Large datasets improve accuracy, but transfer learning helps with small datasets
âœ” Pretrained models (Edge Impulse/TensorFlow Lite) can accelerate development

## Guidelines

1. **Minimum Number of Sources**: You are required to review at least two or three papers, blogs, or authoritative sources related to your project topic.

1. **Summary**: For each work, provide a brief summary that includes the objective of the work, methods used, and the outcomes. One sentence on each point is sufficient.
